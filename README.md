## ü§î FAQ

**Q. What?**  
A: It's bookmarks, but for Erics. So, `bookerics`. Get it?

**Q: That seems like it's marketed to a very niche group.**  
A: That's not a question.

**Q: Can I use this if my name isn't Eric?**  
A: Sure. If you're not lucky enough to be named Eric, you can update the configuration to be booktoms, bookzendayas, bookvolodymyrs, 
etc. I suppose "bookmarks" works as well.

**Q: Do I need AWS and OpenAI to use `bookerics`?**  
A: No, these are optional features. The core bookmark functionality works without external services, but you'll miss out on screenshots, AI tagging, and cloud sync.

**Q: How does the AI tagging work?**  
A: When you save a bookmark without tags, `bookerics` can automatically analyze the content and suggest relevant tags using OpenAI's GPT models.
