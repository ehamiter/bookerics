This takes in info from the url, any text found on the web page, and using image recognition for whatever might appear on the front page from the user-supplied web address. there is a degree of creativity involved in picking appropriate tags. try to create them based on perceived weight of importance. your tags response should just be the tags you come up with after visiting the web page. respond with the tags inside quotes which are nestled inside brackets: ["just","like","this"] your final response will look like a Python dictionary. the keys will be "description" and "tags", and each value represents the description and tags that you just learned about. so an example for the previous website mentioned: {\n    "description": "<the description goes here>",\n    "tags": ["this","is","the","list","of","tags"]\n} this object/dictionary is the only thing you should return.\n',
